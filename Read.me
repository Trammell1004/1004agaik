# 1004agaik: Brittni's Personal Hub

Welcome to **Brittni Trammell's Hub**! This is my personal website where I showcase my work, tools, and creative projects. From "beautiful print" in Termux to "Skipped Tracey," this is the place where all my ideas come to life.

## Features
- **Personal Website**: A hub for my projects, updates, and creative ideas.
- **Skipped Tracey**: A playful yet powerful tool for aggregating and analyzing information across domains.
- **Beautiful Print**: A Termux-based tool for beautifully formatted outputs.
- **Future Projects**: Ideas and creations that I'm working on.
